Returns Forecasting:

Step 1: Calculate Baseline.

	* Baseline will be calculated for the selected period and applied in the calculation.
	
	Baseline Formula  : BASELINE = ACTUAL_RETURN_PERCENT = (SUM(CUM_RETURN_UNITS) / SUM(ORIG_SALE_UNITS)) / No. of Selected Periods

Step 2: Projection Calculateion (Calculate Growth and Cummulative Multiplication)

	* In this step, Baseline for the first period will be taken from the above calculated step.
	  Baseline for the second period and so on.. will be the output of the previous period.

	Projection Formula: PROJECTED_RETURN_PERCENT = BASELINE * ( 1 + GROWTH_RATE)
	
Step 3: Calculate Other Components. (Always calculated in monthly)

	* In Returns, Since the calculation is only based on PROJECTED_RETURN_PERCENT,
	  Once we calculated the PROJECTED_RETURN_PERCENT,We derive all the other values based on the PROJECTED_RETURN_PERCENT using the below formulae.
	
	PROJECTED_RETURN_AMOUNT =  PROJECTED_RETURN_PERCENT*ACTIVE_EXFACTORY_SALES_AMOUNT
	
	PROJECTED_RPU =  PROJECTED_RETURN_AMOUNT/ACTIVE_EXFACTORY_SALES_UNITS
	
	PROJECTED_RETURN_UNITS = PROJECTED_RETURN_AMOUNT/(ACTIVE_EXFACTORY_SALES_AMOUNT/ACTIVE_EXFACTORY_SALES_UNITS)


Commercial Forecasting:


	Sales Projection: 

	Step 1: Calculate Baseline.
		
		* Baseline will be calculated for the selected period and applied in the calculation for the selected component.

			* Sales Based:
			
				Baseline Formula  : BASELINE = ACTUAL_SALES = SUM(ACTUAL_SALES) / No. of Selected Periods
			
			* Unit Based:

				Baseline Formula  : BASELINE = ACTUAL_UNITS = SUM(ACTUAL_UNITS) / No. of Selected Periods
				
	Step 2: Projection Calculateion (Calculate Growth and Cummulative Multiplication)
		
		* In this step, Baseline for the first period will be taken from the above calculated step.
		  Baseline for the second period and so on.. will be the calculated output of the previous period.

			* Sales Based:
			
				Projection Formula  : PROJECTED_SALES = BASELINE * (1+ WAC_INCREASE) * (1 + ACCOUNT_GROWTH) * (1 + PRODUCT_GROWTH)
			
			* Unit Based:

				Projection Formula  : PROJECTED_UNITS = BASELINE * (1 + ACCOUNT_GROWTH) * (1 + PRODUCT_GROWTH)

			WAC_INCREASE = (WAC_NEW_PERIOD - WAC_OLD_PERIOD) / WAC_OLD_PERIOD
			
			WAC_PRICE = FILE_SALES / FILE_UNIT 
					
	Step 3: Apply Allocation Basis. (In Case of Quarterly frequency)
		
			* In this step, the calculated value for that frequency needs to be allocated to each month 
			  based on the month to frequency ratio available in the respective allocation file.
			
			MONTH 1 ALLOCATED PROJECTED_SALES = (MONTH 1 FILE_SALES / (MONTH 1 + MONTH 2 + MONTH 3 FILE_SALES)) * PROJECTED_SALES OF THAT FREQUENCY
			MONTH 2 ALLOCATED PROJECTED_SALES = (MONTH 2 FILE_SALES / (MONTH 1 + MONTH 2 + MONTH 3 FILE_SALES)) * PROJECTED_SALES OF THAT FREQUENCY
			MONTH 3 ALLOCATED PROJECTED_SALES = (MONTH 3 FILE_SALES / (MONTH 1 + MONTH 2 + MONTH 3 FILE_SALES)) * PROJECTED_SALES OF THAT FREQUENCY

			MONTH 1 ALLOCATED PROJECTED_UNITS = (MONTH 1 FILE_UNITS / (MONTH 1 + MONTH 2 + MONTH 3 FILE_UNITS)) * PROJECTED_UNITS OF THAT FREQUENCY
			MONTH 2 ALLOCATED PROJECTED_UNITS = (MONTH 2 FILE_UNITS / (MONTH 1 + MONTH 2 + MONTH 3 FILE_UNITS)) * PROJECTED_UNITS OF THAT FREQUENCY
			MONTH 3 ALLOCATED PROJECTED_UNITS = (MONTH 3 FILE_UNITS / (MONTH 1 + MONTH 2 + MONTH 3 FILE_UNITS)) * PROJECTED_UNITS OF THAT FREQUENCY
			
			Note: Allocation is not needed in monthly frequency.
				
	Step 4: Calculate Other Components. (Always calculated in monthly)

		* Once we calculated the selected component,
		  We derive all the other values based on the selected component using the below formulae.		
		
			* Sales Based:
			
				PROJECTED_UNITS = PROJECTED_SALES / PRICE
				
			* Unit Based:
					
				PROJECTED_SALES = PROJECTED_UNITS * PRICE
		
		

	Discount Projection:

	Step 1: Calculate Baseline.
		
			* Baseline will be calculated for the selected period and applied in the calculation for the selected component.

			* Rate Based:
			
				Baseline Formula	: ACTUAL_RATE = SUM(ACTUAL_DISCOUNT_AMOUNT) / SUM(ACTUAL_SALES) / No. of Selected Periods
				
			* RPU Based:
			
				Baseline Formula	: ACTUAL_RPU = SUM(ACTUAL_DISCOUNT_AMOUNT) / SUM(ACTUAL_UNITS) / No. of Selected Periods
			
			* Amount Based:
			
				Baseline Formula	: ACTUAL_RPU = SUM(ACTUAL_DISCOUNT_AMOUNT) / No. of Selected Periods

	Step 2: Projection Calculateion (Calculate Growth and Cummulative Multiplication)
		
		* In this step, Baseline for the first period will be taken from the above calculated step.
		  Baseline for the second period and so on.. will be the calculated output of the previous period.

			* Rate Based:	
				
				Projection Formula	: PROJECTED_RATE = BASELINE * (1+ GROWTH_RATE)
				
			* RPU Based:	
				
				Projection Formula	: PROJECTED_RPU = BASELINE * (1+ GROWTH_RATE)
				
			* Amount Based:	
				
				Projection Formula	: PROJECTED_AMOUNT = BASELINE * (1+ GROWTH_RATE)
			
	Step 3: Calculate Other Components.(Always calculated in monthly)
		
		* Once we calculated the selected component,
		We derive all the other values based on the selected component using the below formulae.		

			* Rate Based:	
				
					PROJECTED_AMOUNT = PROJECTED_RATE * PROJECTED_SALES
					PROJECTED_RPU    = PROJECTED_AMOUNT / PROJECTED_UNITS
				
			* RPU Based:	
				
					PROJECTED_AMOUNT = PROJECTED_RPU * PROJECTED_UNITS
					PROJECTED_RATE   = PROJECTED_AMOUNT / PROJECTED_SALES
				
			* Amount Based:	
				
					PROJECTED_RATE = PROJECTED_AMOUNT / PROJECTED_SALES
					PROJECTED_RPU  = PROJECTED_AMOUNT / PROJECTED_UNITS
					
					
		Note:
			PROJECTED_SALES - PROJECTED_SALES calculated in the sales projection.
