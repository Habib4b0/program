Returns Forecasting:

Step 1: Calculate Baseline.

		  	
	Baseline Formula  : BASELINE = EX_FACTORY_RATIO =  ACTUAL_RETURN_AMOUNT/ORIG_SALE_DOLLARS

Step 2: Projection Calculation

	* In this step, Baseline value will be the projected return percent.
	* Cummulative Multiplication is not needed in this methodology.

	Projection Formula: PROJECTED_RETURN_AMOUNT = BASELINE * ACTIVE_EXFACTORY_SALES_AMOUNT
	
Step 3: Calculate Other Components. (Always calculated in monthly)

	* In Returns, Since the calculation is only based on PROJECTED_RETURN_PERCENT,
	  Once we calculated the PROJECTED_RETURN_PERCENT,We derive all the other values based on the PROJECTED_RETURN_PERCENT using the below formulae.
	  
		PROJECTED_RETURN_PERCENT = (PROJECTED_RETURN_AMOUNT/(ACTIVE_EXFACTORY_SALES_AMOUNT/ACTIVE_EXFACTORY_SALES_UNITS))/ACTIVE_EXFACTORY_SALES_UNITS

		PROJECTED_RPU = (PROJECTED_RETURN_PERCENT/ACTIVE_EXFACTORY_SALES_AMOUNT)/ACTIVE_EXFACTORY_SALES_UNITS
	
		PROJECTED_RETURN_UNITS = PROJECTED_RETURN_AMOUNT/(ACTIVE_EXFACTORY_SALES_AMOUNT/ACTIVE_EXFACTORY_SALES_UNITS)
		
		
Commercial Forecasting:


Sales Projection:

	Step 1: Calculate Baseline
		
		* Sales Based:
		
		Baseline Formula : BASELINE = EX_FACTORY_RATIO = SUM(ACTUAL_SALES) / SUM(ACTUAL_EX_FACTORY_SALES) 
		
		* Units Based:
		
		Baseline Formula : BASELINE = EX_FACTORY_RATIO = SUM(ACTUAL_UNITS) / SUM(ACTUAL_EX_FACTORY_UNITS) 

	Step 2: Projection Calculation (Always calculated in Monthly)
	
		* In this methodology, Growth and Cummulative multiplication is not needed.

		* Sales Based:
		
		Projection Formula: PROJECTED_SALES = BASELINE * PROJECTED_EXFACTORY_SALES	
		
		* Units Based:
		
		Projection Formula: PROJECTED_UNITS = BASELINE * PROJECTED_EXFACTORY_UNITS
		
	Step 3: Calculate Other Components. (Always calculated in monthly)

			* Once we calculated the selected component,
			  We derive all the other values based on the selected component using the below formulae.		
			
				* Sales Based:
				
					PROJECTED_UNITS = PROJECTED_SALES / PRICE
					
				* Unit Based:
						
					PROJECTED_SALES = PROJECTED_UNITS * PRICE


Discount Projection:

	Step 1: Calculate Baseline.
		
			* Amount Based:
			
				Baseline Formula	: BASELINE = EX_FACTORY_RATIO = SUM(ACTUAL_DISCOUNT_AMOUNT) / SUM(ACTUAL_EX_FACTORY_SALES)

	Step 2: Projection Calculateion (Calculate Growth and Cummulative Multiplication)
		
			* In this methodology, Growth and Cummulative multiplication is not needed.
					
			* Amount Based:	
				
				Projection Formula	: PROJECTED_AMOUNT = BASELINE * PROJECTED_EXFACTORY_SALES
			
	Step 3: Calculate Other Components.(Always calculated in monthly)
		
		* Once we calculated the selected component,
		We derive all the other values based on the selected component using the below formulae.		

			* Amount Based:	
				
					PROJECTED_RATE = PROJECTED_AMOUNT / PROJECTED_SALES
					PROJECTED_RPU  = PROJECTED_AMOUNT / PROJECTED_UNITS
					
					
		Note:
			PROJECTED_SALES - PROJECTED_SALES calculated in the sales projection.
