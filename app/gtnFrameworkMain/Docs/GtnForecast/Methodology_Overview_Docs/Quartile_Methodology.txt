This Methodology available only in returns.


Returns Forecasting:

Step 1: Calculate Baseline.

	* Baseline will be selected in the reverse order from max frequency selected. 
	  First non zero value will be taken as baseline.
	  
	  Example: Selected Baseline Periods:  Q1-2014 = 20, Q2-2014 = 30,Q3-2014 = 0, Q4-2014 = 0
				Eligible baseline values: Q2-2014 = 30.
	
	Baseline Formula  : BASELINE = ACTUAL_RETURN_PERCENT = EXPECTED_RETURN_RATE

Step 2: Projection Calculation

	* In this step, PROJECTED_RETURN_PERCENT will be same as the BASELINE. 
	* Cummulative Multiplication is not needed in this methodology.

	Projection Formula: PROJECTED_RETURN_PERCENT = BASELINE 
	
Step 3: Calculate Other Components. (Always calculated in monthly)

	* In Returns, Since the calculation is only based on PROJECTED_RETURN_PERCENT,
	  Once we calculated the PROJECTED_RETURN_PERCENT,We derive all the other values based on the PROJECTED_RETURN_PERCENT using the below formulae.
	
	PROJECTED_RETURN_AMOUNT =  PROJECTED_RETURN_PERCENT*ACTIVE_EXFACTORY_SALES_AMOUNT
	
	PROJECTED_RPU =  PROJECTED_RETURN_AMOUNT/ACTIVE_EXFACTORY_SALES_UNITS
	
	PROJECTED_RETURN_UNITS = PROJECTED_RETURN_AMOUNT/(ACTIVE_EXFACTORY_SALES_AMOUNT/ACTIVE_EXFACTORY_SALES_UNITS)
