Returns Forecasting:

Step 1: Calculate Baseline.

	* Baseline will be calculated for an entire year. Baseline period should selected for a complete year 
	  irrespective of the frequency selected. 
	
	Baseline Formula  : BASELINE = ACTUAL_RETURN_PERCENT = SUM(CUM_RETURN_UNITS) / SUM(ORIG_SALE_UNITS)

Step 2: Projection Calculation (Calculate Growth and Cummulative Multiplication)

	* In this step, Baseline will be taken from the same month from the previous year, 
	  for which calculation is going to happen in the cureent calculation year.
	  
	  Example:
		Baseline for June 2015 will be value derived from June 2014.
		Baseline for July 2015 will be value derived from July 2014.
	  
	Projection Formula: PROJECTED_RETURN_PERCENT = BASELINE * ( 1 + GROWTH_RATE)
	
Step 3: Calculate Other Components. (Always calculated in monthly)

	* In Returns, Since the calculation is only based on PROJECTED_RETURN_PERCENT,
	  Once we calculated the PROJECTED_RETURN_PERCENT,We derive all the other values based on the PROJECTED_RETURN_PERCENT using the below formulae.
	
	PROJECTED_RETURN_AMOUNT =  PROJECTED_RETURN_PERCENT*ACTIVE_EXFACTORY_SALES_AMOUNT
	
	PROJECTED_RPU =  PROJECTED_RETURN_AMOUNT/ACTIVE_EXFACTORY_SALES_UNITS
	
	PROJECTED_RETURN_UNITS = PROJECTED_RETURN_AMOUNT/(ACTIVE_EXFACTORY_SALES_AMOUNT/ACTIVE_EXFACTORY_SALES_UNITS)


Commercial Forecasting:


	Sales Projection: 

	Step 1: Calculate Baseline.
		
	* Baseline will be calculated for an entire year. Baseline period should selected for a complete year 
	  irrespective of the frequency selected.

			* Sales Based:
			
				Baseline Formula  : BASELINE = ACTUAL_SALES = SUM(ACTUAL_SALES)
			
			* Unit Based:

				Baseline Formula  : BASELINE = ACTUAL_UNITS = SUM(ACTUAL_UNITS)
				
	Step 2: Projection Calculateion (Calculate Growth and Cummulative Multiplication)
		
		* In this step, Baseline will be taken from the same frequency component from the previous year, 
		  for which calculation is going to happen in the cureent calculation year.
		  
		  Example:
			Baseline for Q1 2015 will be value derived from Q1 2014.
			Baseline for Q2 2015 will be value derived from Q2 2014.

			* Sales Based:
				
				Projection Formula  : PROJECTED_SALES = BASELINE * (1+ WAC_INCREASE) * (1 + ACCOUNT_GROWTH) * (1 + PRODUCT_GROWTH)
			
			* Unit Based:

				Projection Formula  : PROJECTED_UNITS = BASELINE * (1 + ACCOUNT_GROWTH) * (1 + PRODUCT_GROWTH)

			WAC_INCREASE = (WAC_NEW_PERIOD - WAC_OLD_PERIOD) / WAC_OLD_PERIOD
			
			WAC_PRICE = FILE_SALES / FILE_UNIT 
					
	Step 3: Apply Allocation Basis. (In Case of Quarterly frequency)
		
			* In this step, the calculated value for that frequency needs to be allocated to each month 
			  based on the month to frequency ratio available in the respective allocation file.
			
			MONTH 1 ALLOCATED PROJECTED_SALES = (MONTH 1 FILE_SALES / (MONTH 1 + MONTH 2 + MONTH 3 FILE_SALES)) * PROJECTED_SALES OF THAT FREQUENCY
			MONTH 2 ALLOCATED PROJECTED_SALES = (MONTH 2 FILE_SALES / (MONTH 1 + MONTH 2 + MONTH 3 FILE_SALES)) * PROJECTED_SALES OF THAT FREQUENCY
			MONTH 3 ALLOCATED PROJECTED_SALES = (MONTH 3 FILE_SALES / (MONTH 1 + MONTH 2 + MONTH 3 FILE_SALES)) * PROJECTED_SALES OF THAT FREQUENCY

			MONTH 1 ALLOCATED PROJECTED_UNITS = (MONTH 1 FILE_UNITS / (MONTH 1 + MONTH 2 + MONTH 3 FILE_UNITS)) * PROJECTED_UNITS OF THAT FREQUENCY
			MONTH 2 ALLOCATED PROJECTED_UNITS = (MONTH 2 FILE_UNITS / (MONTH 1 + MONTH 2 + MONTH 3 FILE_UNITS)) * PROJECTED_UNITS OF THAT FREQUENCY
			MONTH 3 ALLOCATED PROJECTED_UNITS = (MONTH 3 FILE_UNITS / (MONTH 1 + MONTH 2 + MONTH 3 FILE_UNITS)) * PROJECTED_UNITS OF THAT FREQUENCY
			
			Note: Allocation is not needed in monthly frequency.
				
	Step 4: Calculate Other Components. (Always calculated in monthly)

		* Once we calculated the selected component,
		  We derive all the other values based on the selected component using the below formulae.		
		
			* Sales Based:
			
				PROJECTED_UNITS = PROJECTED_SALES / PRICE
				
			* Unit Based:
					
				PROJECTED_SALES = PROJECTED_UNITS * PRICE
		
		

	Discount Projection:

	Step 1: Calculate Baseline.
		
	* Baseline will be calculated for an entire year. Baseline period should selected for a complete year 
	  irrespective of the frequency selected.

			* Rate Based:
			
				Baseline Formula	: ACTUAL_RATE = SUM(ACTUAL_DISCOUNT_AMOUNT) / SUM(ACTUAL_SALES)
				
			* RPU Based:
			
				Baseline Formula	: ACTUAL_RPU = SUM(ACTUAL_DISCOUNT_AMOUNT) / SUM(ACTUAL_UNITS)
			
			* Amount Based:
			
				Baseline Formula	: ACTUAL_RPU = SUM(ACTUAL_DISCOUNT_AMOUNT)

	Step 2: Projection Calculateion (Calculate Growth and Cummulative Multiplication)
		
		* In this step, Baseline will be taken from the same frequency component from the previous year, 
		  for which calculation is going to happen in the cureent calculation year.
		  
		  Example:
			Baseline for Q1 2015 will be value derived from Q1 2014.
			Baseline for Q2 2015 will be value derived from Q2 2014.

			* Rate Based:	
				
				Projection Formula	: PROJECTED_RATE = BASELINE * (1+ GROWTH_RATE)
				
			* RPU Based:	
				
				Projection Formula	: PROJECTED_RPU = BASELINE * (1+ GROWTH_RATE)
				
			* Amount Based:	
				
				Projection Formula	: PROJECTED_AMOUNT = BASELINE * (1+ GROWTH_RATE)
			
	Step 3: Calculate Other Components.(Always calculated in monthly)
		
		* Once we calculated the selected component,
		  We derive all the other values based on the selected component using the below formulae.		

			* Rate Based:	
				
					PROJECTED_AMOUNT = PROJECTED_RATE * PROJECTED_SALES
					PROJECTED_RPU    = PROJECTED_AMOUNT / PROJECTED_UNITS
				
			* RPU Based:	
				
					PROJECTED_AMOUNT = PROJECTED_RPU * PROJECTED_UNITS
					PROJECTED_RATE   = PROJECTED_AMOUNT / PROJECTED_SALES
				
			* Amount Based:	
				
					PROJECTED_RATE = PROJECTED_AMOUNT / PROJECTED_SALES
					PROJECTED_RPU  = PROJECTED_AMOUNT / PROJECTED_UNITS
					
			Note:
			PROJECTED_SALES - PROJECTED_SALES calculated in the sales projection.
