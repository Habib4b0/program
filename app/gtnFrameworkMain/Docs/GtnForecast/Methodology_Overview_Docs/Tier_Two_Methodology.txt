This Methodology available only in returns.

Returns Forecasting:

Step 1: Calculate Baseline.

	* In Other Methodologies,Baseline will be calculated separately for each record.
	  In this methodology, Baseline is calculated by suming values of all selected records and selecte period.
	  
	  	
	Baseline Formula  : BASELINE = ACTUAL_RETURN_PERCENT = SUM(CUM_RETURN_UNITS)/SUM(ORIG_SALE_UNITS)

Step 2: Projection Calculateion (Calculate Growth)

	* In this step, Baseline value will be the projected return percent.
	* Cummulative Multiplication is not needed in this methodology.

	Projection Formula: PROJECTED_RETURN_PERCENT = BASELINE*(1+(GROWTH_RATE)) 
	
Step 3: Calculate Other Components. (Always calculated in monthly)

	* In Returns, Since the calculation is only based on PROJECTED_RETURN_PERCENT,
	  Once we calculated the PROJECTED_RETURN_PERCENT,We derive all the other values based on the PROJECTED_RETURN_PERCENT using the below formulae.
	
	PROJECTED_RETURN_AMOUNT =  PROJECTED_RETURN_PERCENT*ACTIVE_EXFACTORY_SALES_AMOUNT
	
	PROJECTED_RPU =  PROJECTED_RETURN_AMOUNT/ACTIVE_EXFACTORY_SALES_UNITS
	
	PROJECTED_RETURN_UNITS = PROJECTED_RETURN_AMOUNT/(ACTIVE_EXFACTORY_SALES_AMOUNT/ACTIVE_EXFACTORY_SALES_UNITS)
